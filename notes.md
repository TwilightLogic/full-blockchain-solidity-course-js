# Full BlockChain Solidity Learning

### Calculate Transaction Fee

Transaction Fee = ( Block Base Fee Per Gas + MaxPriorityFee Per Gas ) \* Gas Used

- Base Fee: The minimum "gas price" to send your transaction

- 1 Eth = 1000000000 GWei = 1000000000000000000 Wei

### Consensus

Consensus is the mechanism used to agree on the state of a blockchain.

### 1. Chain Selection Algorithm

### 2. Sybil Resistance Mechanism

- Like PoW(Proof of Work) and PoS(Proof of Stake)
